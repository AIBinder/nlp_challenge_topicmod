# SUMM AI NLP Challenge - Topic Modeling with LLM 🚀

## Objective
Fine-tune an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) such as Llama2 to perform topic modeling on a collection of text paragraphs. The model should generate a meaningful topic for a given text.

## Dataset
There is no dataset provided. Find a relevant dataset related to this task.

## Submission
Submit a well-organized codebase along with a README documenting the setup, key findings, and challenges.  
You have one week to complete the assignment. ⏰

## Evaluation Criteria
The focus of this assignment is on the development process and the ability to fine-tune an LLM. Don't worry too much about the performance of the model as long as you know how to improve it.
The following criteria will be used to evaluate the assignment:

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Readability and organization of the code. 📦

2. **Documentation:**
   - Clarity and completeness of the documentation. 📚

3. **(Bonus for Docker environment) 🐳**
